Moodle: 
administrator user, Teacher user, Student user and maybe parent user
2. Perhaps 2 types of deployment, education and business
3. When a student is taking a test or assignment, application uses camera and awareness to make sure student is there watching and not on another browser tab
4. Create lessons using AI prompts and feeding material (pdf, video, powerpoint etc)
5. AI generated assignments, test and quizzes
6. AI chatbot that is focused on the current course that can assist with a students understanding of the material
7. Auto generated practice assignments
8. After a test, quiz or assign,ent, AI can provide insight on things that student got wrong and what aspect of the lesson to focus on
9. Ability to upload and store lectures, video courses or presentations, extract and transcribe then provide search and interaction based on the lectures or seminars etc. So a student may 'attend' a class by watching the recorded class, it monitors the student to ensure they are there, a notes section for the student etc. Like doing an assignment, but it is watching the class.
10 Ability to search with AI across recorded classes for insight, or to rewatch a part of a presentation etc
11. realtime 'captions' of or tranlations into another language for foreign language students (if we could do auto voiceovers in another language... wow awesome
12. PowerBI integration for robust analytics, dashboards, etc etc... different reporting needs for students, teachers, administrators. etc all normal LMS needs I'm sure.


We will have FFireside LMS, a fully AI enabled LMS system for both corporations and education environments

And I'll have even more work for you guys. The important thing is that the fireside AI capabilities and structure that we build, I want it to be robust and flexible enough to be able to create agents, build solutions across the fireside portfolio of products
